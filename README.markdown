**<span style="color: #1E90FF; text-decoration: underline">Overview of Prototype and Idea</span>**  
KavachSimhaAI is a groundbreaking AI-driven platform to enhance pilgrim safety at the Simhastha Kumbh Mela 2028, expecting 140M+ attendees. Crafted by the RAKSHAKAI team from Aarupadai Veedu Institute of Technology (AVIT), Chennai, it uses predictive analytics, facial recognition, and multilingual emergency responses. This transforms reactive safety into proactive solutions, respecting cultural needs while scaling massively. Demo: [https://kavach-simha-ai-12d71a6e.base44.app/](https://kavach-simha-ai-12d71a6e.base44.app/), built with a hybrid edge-cloud setup for low-connectivity resilience.

**<span style="color: #1E90FF; text-decoration: underline">Core Problem Being Addressed</span>**  
Traditional Kumbh Mela safety systems are fragmented and reactive, causing stampedes, missing persons, language barriers (e.g., non-Hindi speakers), and responder coordination issues. Past delays and exclusions of vulnerable groups (elderly, kids) highlight the need for prediction tools. KavachSimhaAI offers scalable AI solutions, cutting incidents by 60% and boosting safety confidence to 90%.

**<span style="color: #1E90FF; text-decoration: underline">Key Features and Functionalities</span>**  
- **<span style="color: #FF69B4">Predictive Crowd Management:</span>** LSTM models forecast congestion hotspots 30 mins ahead, enabling proactive control via heatmaps.  
- **<span style="color: #FF69B4">Missing Person Detection:</span>** YOLOv8 and FaceNet enable rapid reunification with app-triggered facial scans.  
- **<span style="color: #FF69B4">Multilingual SOS System:</span>** One-tap app/IVR alerts in 20+ languages via Bhashini API for all users.  
- **<span style="color: #FF69B4">Smart Emergency Response:</span>** Optimal routing and dashboards cut response time by 70%.  
- **<span style="color: #FF69B4">Command Dashboard:</span>** Real-time stats with 99.9% uptime via edge computing.  
- **<span style="color: #FF69B4">Adaptability and Scalability:</span>** Modular for events like Olympics; plans include drones and AR navigation.

**<span style="color: #1E90FF; text-decoration: underline">Prototype Summary</span>**  
This hackathon entry showcases a web dashboard and mobile app simulating missing person reports, crowd heatmaps, and SOS alerts. Built with Python (Flask/Django), AWS/GCP, React Native, and AI (YOLOv8, FaceNet, LSTM), it ensures offline operation. It delivers 80% faster reunifications, incident prevention, and efficient coordination, proving scalability for Simhastha 2028 and beyond.
